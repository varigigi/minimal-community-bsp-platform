= Minimal Community BSP

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir minimal-community-bsp
$: cd minimal-community-bsp
$: repo init -u https://github.com/varigigi/minimal-community-bsp-platform -b master
$: repo sync

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build:

[source,console]
$: MACHINE=<machine> DISTRO=<distro> source setup-environment <build directory>
$: bitbake core-image-minimal

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at `minimal-community-bsp/sources`.
